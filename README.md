# penta-b-task
## First of all the project include two folders ( test , marsRover)
marsRover includes execution folder which has the commands execution.
States folder which has the 4 operations in our task.
API file about sending the order to execute.
CommandTranslation file is the master file, it can control all of the execution orders and traslate the commands and see what is the invalid one and reject it.
position file just has x,y and the basics operations on it.
finally Rover.java is the rover object itself to control him and his movements and know his states right now,etc..



test folder has execution test and states test only.
I couldn't do more, i don't have any experience on testing before, but i will learn soon.
thanks for your understanding.
