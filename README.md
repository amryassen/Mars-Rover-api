# penta-b-task
## First of all the project include two folders ( test , marsRover)
marsRover includes execution folder which has the commands execution.  <br />
States folder which has the 4 operations in our task. <br />
API file about sending the order to execute. <br />
CommandTranslation file is the master file, it can control all of the execution orders and traslate the commands and see what is the invalid one and reject it. <br />
position file just has x,y and the basics operations on it. <br />
finally Rover.java is the rover object itself to control him and his movements and know his states right now,etc.. <br />



test folder has execution test and states test only. <br />
I couldn't do more, i don't have any experience on testing before, but i will learn soon. <br />
thanks for your understanding. <br />
